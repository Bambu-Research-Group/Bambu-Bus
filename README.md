# Bambu-Bus
Tools &amp; Documentation relating to the Bambu Bus

## Introduction
The bambu-bus is a proprietary protocol, based on UART trough a RS485 bus<br>
The UART is clocked at 1228800bps with 1 even parity bit and 1 stop bit

## Headers and Devices Adressing
The bambu bus is using 2 packet formats,<br>
The long header packet, which has data indication the master and slave between multiple avaible devices<br>
And The short header packet, which communicate between 1 preset master and slave

these packets are usually comprised of a start byte _3D_, a packet lenght indicator, and an 8 bit CRC for verifying the header integrity.<br>

### Long form header

| Byte number | Content                          | Bytes occupied |
|-------------|----------------------------------|----------------|
| 0           | 0x3D                             | 1              |
| 1           | Flag(less than 0x80)             | 1              |
| 2~3         | Packet sequence                  | 2              |
| 4~5         | Total packet length L            | 2              |
| 6           | CRC8 for all previous bytes [1]  | 1              |
| 7~8         | Target address                   | 2              |
| 9~10        | Source address                   | 2              |
| 11~(L-3)    | Packet content                   | L-13           |
| (L-2)~(L-1) | CRC16 for all previous bytes [2] | 2              |

[1] CRC8 generation polynomial: 0x39, initial value 0x66, no XOR and reverse.  
[2] CRC16 generation polynomial:0x1021, initial value 0x913D, no XOR and reverse, but low byte first in the array.
